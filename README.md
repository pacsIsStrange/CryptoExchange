# Cryptocurrency Exchange Software

### This repository contains the implementation of a cryptocurrency exchange software developed as a university project. The software simulates a cryptocurrency trading platform where users can buy and sell various cryptocurrencies. The exchange rates for these cryptocurrencies are randomly generated and do not reflect real-time market values.
